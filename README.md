Recipes
========

This is a personal project of mine.

The project is a 3rd generation version of this project.  I hope to continue to improve it, but really,
I just want to make it work via the web and get a new working version as the old one is getting out of date quickly.

The project is a simple one really.  We used to do Once-A-Month cooking which we started doing from a cook book.

We enjoyed doing the cooking, but wanted a simple way to do it with our own recipes and selection of recipes.  That
is what this project is eventually about doing.

This project is also a way for me to learn Ruby.

Since it is a learning project, some of the code really sucks.

Since it is a home/personal project, it is taking forever as I find time to work on it.

Since I'm learning, I'm refactoring all the time.

To do:

* Aliased table unit tests
* paging rspec tests
* Generic aliases
* Cucumber tests.  Add Poltergeist as well as Selenium support
* * use galaxy-test_support as well.
* * Page objects
* Generic find for models
* Picker scrolls to select item
* Type ahead on picker
* Ingredient model
* Ingredient aliases
* Ingredient Cr.U.D.
* Measuring Unit tabs
* Measuring Unit Aliases
* Conversions
* Ingredients
* Measuring Unit Tab - Ingredients
* Ingredient Conversions
* Recipe
* Meal Plans
* Save validate data client side - forgot what this one was...
* custom scrolling - only hold so many pages
* IsScrollable with routing helper function
* Scrollbar shows relative position (maybe a list item with a custom height to save space for non-showed items?)
* Make tabs AJAXy?
* Look into can-can?
* Look into pretty forms?

Sample recipes:

Ingredients
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 large shallots, minced
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup dry sherry
3 3/4 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
6 sprigs plus 1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more, to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more, to taste
Pinch cayenne pepper
Pinch freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/2 cup creme fraiche or heavy cream
4 cups 1-inch cubed poached chicken, recipe follows
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
Serving suggestions: Buttered noodles, toast points, biscuits, or crepes
Directions
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/4 cup of the butter, and saute the shallots until softened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes. Whisk in the sherry and broth and bring to a boil while stirring. Add the parsley and thyme sprigs, lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook the sauce for 30 minutes, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the mushrooms until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Strain the sauce into mushrooms and season with the salt, pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg. Whisk in the creme fraiche.

Add the minced parsley, chicken, and chives to the sauce, and bring to a simmer. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately over noodles, toast points, split baking powder biscuits or wrapped in crepes.

POACHED CHICKEN
10 sprigs parsley
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 small onion, halved
1 small carrot, halved
1 stalk celery, halved
3 pounds chicken breasts halves, on the bone and fat trimmed
5 to 6 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
Put the parsley, thyme, onion, carrot, celery, and chicken breasts in a medium saucepan. Cover with the broth, and bring just to a boil. Lower the heat to very low and cover. Poach the chicken for 20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover, and cool the chicken in the liquid for 30 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and reserve the liquid. Bone and skin the chicken and cut the meat into cubes. Discard the bones and skin.

Strain the broth and store, covered, in the refrigerator for 3 days or freeze for later use. Remove any fat from the surface of the broth before using.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
